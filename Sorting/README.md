```Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping
 the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. 
This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

Time Complexity: O(N2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1) 

Worst Case Analysis for Bubble Sort:
The worst-case condition for bubble sort occurs when elements of the array are arranged in decreasing order.
In the worst case, the total number of iterations or passes required to sort a given array is (n-1). where ‘n’ is a number of elements present in the array.
