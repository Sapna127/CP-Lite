# What's Inside ðŸ—ƒ
- Advanced Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Problem Statements 
- Techiques to solve problems
- Short Tricks

## Path 
Go through the repo folders this way -
1. Decide the thing you want to contribute like algorithm, problem statement etc.
2. Open the required folder -
   There you will find the algorithms that I want to add you can fetch the issue and add the same
3. For the understanding of other people please update the readme file as soon as you add something new in the folder. 
   You can find seperate readme file for each folder add some theory for everything you will add.
Following this steps the repo will be readable to everyone.


## Read the following steps before contributing.
### Algorithms

|                |Follow these steps                         	|
|----------------|-------------------------------|
|New Algorithm|`'Please see if the algorithm is already present'`|
| What to include |`"Your algorithm should be efficiently written with proper code / comments / time complexity / space complexity / link to gfg or any other documentation on top in code file"`            |
|Where to include         |`'please commit your algorithm in the correct folder'`|
| README | `"Please check whether your directory has a README file, if there is then edit your algorithm name with a link, otherwise create a new one "`

### Problem Statement 

|                |Follow these steps                         	|
|----------------|-------------------------------|
|New Problem Statement|`'Please see if the problem is present already? If it is do not commit your own '`|
| What to include |`"Your problem statement solution should be efficiently written with proper code / comments / time complexity / space complexity / link to problem statement in code file"`            |
|Where to include         |`please commit your problem solution in the correct folder or discuss` [here](https://github.com/Lakhankumawat/LearnCPP/discussions/7) `before committing for where to include`|
| README | `"Please check whether your directory has a README file, if there is then edit your algorithm name with a link, otherwise create a new one "`

### To add ```DATA Stuctures``` or programs using ```STL```, follow the same approach as  ```Algorithms```


## Why contribute?
- If you find any errors or bugs then please report them by creating an issue. 
- If you can provide a more efficient solution or implementation of the algorithm then make sure to contribute. 
- If you want to implement an algorithm, data structure etc.., which is not yet there, then you can open up a PR regarding the same.
 
## Want to contribute?
- Take a look at [`contributing guidelines`](Contribute.md) if you're interested in helping!
- Refer [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow). 

A queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First Out (FIFO) order.

We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end, and all deletions from the list are made at the other end.  The element which is first pushed into the order, the operation is first performed on that.
