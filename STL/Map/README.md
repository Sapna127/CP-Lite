### Maps 
They are associative containers that store elements in a mapped fashion. Each element has a key value and a mapped value. No two mapped values can have the same key values.

### Some basic functions associated with Map: 
```
begin() – Returns an iterator to the first element in the map.
end() – Returns an iterator to the theoretical element that follows the last element in the map.
size() – Returns the number of elements in the map.
max_size() – Returns the maximum number of elements that the map can hold.
empty() – Returns whether the map is empty.
pair insert(keyvalue, mapvalue) – Adds a new element to the map.
erase(iterator position) – Removes the element at the position pointed by the iterator.
erase(const g)– Removes the key-value ‘g’ from the map.
clear() – Removes all the elements from the map.
